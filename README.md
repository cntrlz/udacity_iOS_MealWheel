# MealWheel [![cntrlz]]()

MealWheel is an iOS app that solves the perpetual problem of "where am I gonna eat?"

If you're in a hurry, it can spin up a spot in one press of a button.

If you want some more customization, quickly add places to eat or use MealWheel's filters to narrow down a perfect set of places to choose from, and then SPIN!

## RUNNING MEALWHEEL

1. Install pods
2. Open .xcworkspace
3. Buil and run :)

## TODO

- [x] Make frequency slider and label text work on AddNew controller
- [x] Write Readme
- [x] Make it so that changing a slider or segmented control value updates controller with "hasChanges"
- [ ] Update search to include filter: frequency slider
